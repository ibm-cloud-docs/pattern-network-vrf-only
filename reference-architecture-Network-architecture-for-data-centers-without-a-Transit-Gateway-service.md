# Reference Architecture
{: #network-vrf-only}
{: toc-content-type="reference-architecture"}
{: toc-version="1.0"}

This reference architecture is used in disaster recovery scenarios where either the primary or disaster recovery site is a classic data center where {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} is not available. Currently, the list includes centers such as Montreal 01, San Jose 03, San Jose 04, Chennai 01, and Hong Kong S.A.R. of the PRC 02. For more information, see see [{{site.data.keyword.tg_short}} locations](/docs/transit-gateway?topic=transit-gateway-tg-locations#szr-table).

This approach is referred to as classic data center because there is no VPC and Transit Gateway connectivity used.
{: note}

Itâ€™s a common approach to complement classic environments with VPC services. This allows extra functionality that is only available with VPC services. The following information in this document references this approach as complementary VPC services and is highlighted in this pattern.

## Architecture diagram
{: #architecture-diagram}

This architecture describes on-premises data center connectivity into {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} classic, with firewall services and a {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} workspace. The diagram includes examples of where workload compute instances, proxy servers, and bastion hosts are located. The diagram contains identifying numbers indicating key components in the description.

In this diagram, Region 1 represents a classic data center where {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} is not available and Region 2 illustrates a classic data center in a multi-zone region where {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} is available.

1.  The optional network path is accomplished through site-to-site VPN terminated on a classic gateway.
2.  The client network connectivity from on-premises using {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}}.
3.  The gateway provides routing and security functions.
4.  The virtual bastion host supports remote administrative access.
5.  GREa tunnel allows Bring Your Own IP to be advertised between classic and on-premises. Two GRE tunnels allow for resiliency.
6.  GREb tunnel allows Bring Your Own IP to be advertised between classic environments in separate regions. Two GRE tunnels allow for resiliency.
7.  GREc tunnel allows Bring Your Own IP to be advertised between classic and PowerVS. Two GRE tunnels allow for resiliency.
8.  Private Cloud Service Endpoints (CSE) allow access to cloud services over the private network.
9.  The proxy server acts as an intermediary between on-premises and cloud services.
10. Cloud Internet Services (CIS) is used to enhance the security, performance, and reliability of internet-facing applications and websites.
11. {{site.data.keyword.vpe_full}} as an alternative to Cloud Service Endpoints and proxy server allow access to cloud services over the private network.
12. A custom DNS resolver in classic is used for a fully qualified domain name resolution.
13. DNS services on VPC as an alternative to custom DNS in classic.
14. In region 2, TGW1 advertises and routes on-premises traffic to classic for gateway or firewall inspection.
15. In region 2, TGW2 advertises and routes local traffic between classic, VPC, and PowerVS.
16. In region 2, TGW3 advertises and routes global traffic between regions for VPC and PowerVS.
17. {{site.data.keyword.loadbalancer_full}} provides local application load balancing.

## Design scope
{: #design-scope}

Following the [{{site.data.keyword.arch_framework}}](/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-taxonomy), the classic data center network pattern covers design considerations and architecture decisions for the following aspects and domains:

- Compute: Virtual Servers, Bare Metal Servers
- Networking: Enterprise Connectivity, Bring Your Own IP and Edge Gateways, Network Segmentation, Cloud Native Connectivity, Load Balancing, and DNS
- Security: Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Resiliency: High Availability, Disaster Recovery
- Service management: Monitoring, Logging, Auditing, and Alerting

![Illustrates a detailed network and component architecture for a classic data center solution architecture](images/heat_map.svg){: caption="Figure 2. Classic data center design scope" caption-side="bottom"}

The {{site.data.keyword.arch_framework}} provides a consistent approach to design cloud solutions by addressing requirements across a set of aspects and domains, which are technology-agnostic architectural areas that need to be considered for any enterprise solution. For more information, see [Introduction to the architecture framework](/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro) for more details.

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The following represents a baseline set of requirements that are applicable to most clients and critical to successful classic data center network deployment. The pattern assumes that the client has a requirement of geolocation, data residency, or low latency that requires resource deployment in a data center that does not have transit gateway technology.
