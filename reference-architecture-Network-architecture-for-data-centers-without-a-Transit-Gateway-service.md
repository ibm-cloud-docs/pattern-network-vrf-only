# Network architecture
{: #network-vrf-only}
{: toc-content-type="reference-architecture"}
{: toc-version="1.0"}

This reference architecture is used in data centers that currently don't have {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} and {{site.data.keyword.tg_short}} (TGW) services available. As of January 2023, this includes centers such as Montreal 01, San Jose 03, San Jose 04, Chennai 01, and Hong Kong 02. For an updated list of the data centers that have Transit Gateway, see [{{site.data.keyword.tg_short}} locations](/docs/transit-gateway?topic=transit-gateway-tg-locations#szr-table).

This approach is refered to from now on as Classic Data Center because there is no VPC and TGW connectivity used. It is a common approach to complement classic environments with VPC services. This approach allows additional functionality that is only available with VPC services. This document references this approach as complementary VPC services and it is highlighted throughout the pattern.

## Architecture diagram
{: #architecture-diagram}

This architecture describes on-premises data center connectivity into {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} classic, with firewall services and a {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} workspace. The diagram includes examples to show where workload compute instances, proxy servers, and jump servers can be found. The diagram contains identifying numbers indicating key components in the description.

In this diagram, region 1 represents a classic data center where {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} is not available and region 2 illustrates a Classic Data Center in a Multi-Zone Region where {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} is available.

1.  Optional network path is accomplished through site-to-site VPN terminated on Classic Gateway.
2.  Client network connectivity from on-premises using {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}}.
3.  The gateway provides routing and security functions.
4.  Virtual Bastion host supports remote administrative access.
5.  GREa tunnel allows Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP)  to be advertised between classic and on-premises. Two GRE tunnels allow for resiliency.
6.  GREb tunnel allows Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP)  to be advertised between classic environments in separate regions. Two GRE tunnels allow for resiliency.
7.  GREc tunnel allows Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP)  to be advertised between classic and PowerVS. Two GRE tunnels allow for resiliency.
8.  Private Cloud Service Endpoints (CSE) allow access to cloud services over the private network.
9.  The proxy Server acts as an intermediary between on-prem and cloud services.
10. Cloud Internet Services (CIS) is used to enhance the security, performance, and reliability of internet-facing applications and websites.
11. {{site.data.keyword.vpe_full}} as an alternative to CSE and Proxy server allow access to cloud services over the private network.
12. Custom DNS resolver in Classic is used for FQDN resolution.
13. DNS services on VPC as an alternative to custom DNS in classic.
14. In region 2, TGW1 advertises and routes on-premise traffic to Classic for gateway or firewall inspection.
15. In region 2, TGW2 advertises and routes local traffic between Classic, VPC, and PowerVS.
16. In region 2, TGW3 advertises and routes Global traffic between regions for VPC and PowerVS.
17. {{site.data.keyword.loadbalancer_full}} provides local application load balancing.

## Design scope
{: #design-scope}

Following the [Architecture Framework](/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-taxonomy), the non-TGW network pattern covers design considerations and architecture decisions for the following aspects and domains:

- Compute: Virtual Servers, Bare Metal Servers
- Networking: Enterprise Connectivity, BYOIP and Edge Gateways, Network Segmentation, Cloud Native Connectivity, Load Balancing, and DNS
- Security: Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Resiliency: High Availability, Disaster Recovery
- Service management: Monitoring, Logging, Auditing, Alerting, Event Management

![Illustrates a detailed network and component architecture for a Hybrid cloud network for classic infrastructure disaster recovery solution architecture](./heat_map.svg){: caption="Figure 2: Hybrid cloud network for classic infrastructure disaster recovery design scope" caption-side="bottom"}

The Architecture Framework provides a consistent approach to design cloud solutions by addressing requirements across a set of aspects and domains, which are technology-agnostic architectural areas that need to be considered for any enterprise solution. For more information, see [Introduction to the architecture framework](/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro).

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The following represents a baseline set of requirements that are applicable to most clients and critical to successful non-TGW network deployment. The pattern assumes the client has a requirement of geolocation, data residency, or low latency that requires resource deployment in a data center that does not have transit gateway technology.
