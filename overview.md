 this test

 This is a hybrid cloud disaster recovery network solution for enterprise workloads in regions with data residency requirements. The objective of this pattern is to:

- Illustrate network connectivity to {{site.data.keyword.powerSysShort}} workspace and classic infrastructure resources.
- Provide an {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} solution design for the network elements that are required for DR scenarios where either the primary or DR site is a classic data venter where VPC is not available.
- Securely connect your external locations to {{site.data.keyword.dl_full}}, enabling access to both classic infrastructure and {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} resources.
- To focus on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} network elements, while ensuring that requirements can be met from a performance, system availability, and connectivity perspective.

This pattern is intended to:

- Accelerate and simplify solution design by providing a standard {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} deployment architecture reference by following the [IBM {{site.data.keyword.arch_framework}}](/docs/architecture-framework).
- Provide a prescriptive, end-to-end enterprise-class solution design with diagrams, component architecture decisions, and rationale for cloud component selection to meet enterprise requirements.
