# Overview
{: #Overview-id}

 This is a hybrid cloud disaster recovery network solution for enterprise workloads in regions with data residency requirements. The objective of this pattern is to:

-   Illustrate network connectivity to {{site.data.keyword.powerSysShort}} Workspace and Classic infrastructure resources.
-   Provide an IBM Solution Design for the Network elements that are required when deploying in Classic Data Centers or a data center that does not contain availability zones.
-   Securely connect your external locations to {{site.data.keyword.dl_full}}, enabling access to both Classic infrastructure and {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} resources.
-   To focus on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Network elements, while ensuring requirements can be met from a performance, system availability, and connectivity perspective.

This pattern is intended to:

-   Accelerate and simplify solution design by providing a standard  {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} deployment architecture reference by following the [IBM Architecture Framework](/docs/architecture-framework).
-   Provide a prescriptive, end-2-end enterprise-class solution design, with diagrams, component architecture decisions along with rationale for cloud component selection to meet enterprise requirements.
